# Transaction App | Building our Api
The next step in our application is building our CRUD api and deploying it. You're free to experiment with any frameworks or deployment tools that you want.


## Goals

Your goal is to build a full CRUD api. You're free to build the same api in multiple frameworks if you would like. The goal is to get the lowest request response time for the `/transactions` get route (get all).

The main point to consider is what's the best format to send the data back? Is sending all 1,000,000 entries back as an array a good idea?
